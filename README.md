## Introduction

[View web page in GitHub Pages](https://github.com/dugudugu/Paradise-in-Curacao)

## UX

The inspiration for this page can from planning various vacations. When planning a vacation, I can use up to 10 different webpage to search for hotels, car rental and restaurants. The goal for the webpage is to be a one-stop-shop for vacation; in this case I’ll take you to the beautiful Island of Curacao.

### User stories:

- As someone that like to travel, I would like a simple page that is easy to navigate and has everything I would need to plan my vacation
- As someone that is looking for their next vacation: I would like for this page to be attract people into wanting to go to Curacao
- As some that that has already booked there vacation to Curacao, I would like this webpage to give them any information that they’ve missed


### Webframe:

For the webframe I have created two diffrent versions. One for mobile devices (max-width: 768px) and one for larger devices. The idea for the mobile version is to keep everything simple, and minimize the usage of mobile data to load the webpage. 
<div align="center">
	<a href="https://dugudugu.github.io/Paradise-in-Curacao/">
	<h3>Desktop Version (min-width: 768px)</h3>

## Features

### Existing features
1.	Navbar – Consists of the Paradise in Curacao logo which returns the user to the top of the webpage. There are also links to the “About”, “Hotels”, “Restaurants”, Car Rentals” and “Activities”. The navbar will scroll with the webpage. 
2.	About – The about section includes 5 facts and 4 images of Curacao. With the last two facts, the user is able to click on the title and will be directed to an external webpage with more information about the fact. 
3.	Hotels – Directs the user to the “Hotels” section of the webpage which will display 5 hotels. The first hotel will have a more details information about it and the other 4 will have a short description. The titles of the hotels will be clickable, which will redirect the user to an external page where the user will be able to make a reservation.
4.	Restaurant – Provides the user with a list of restaurants were the user can eat when in Curacao. To give the user an idea where the restaurant is on the island, when the mouse is moved over the list an info window will pop up in a google maps next to the list. The info window will include a “reserve” button where the user can click to make reservations on an external webpage.
5.	Car Rentals – For the car rental section I’ve choose to only show the logo of the car rental. When the user clicks on a logo, the user will be re-directed to an external webpage where he/she can make reservation. 
6.	Activities – The Activities section contains images of different locations on the island. When the user hover over the image, the name of the activity will be shown. The user will be re-directed to an external webpage when clicked on the image.
